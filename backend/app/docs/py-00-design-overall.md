BeeWare is the cleanest “pure-Python” path for shipping to both iOS and Android with a shared codebase, and it pairs very well with a FastAPI backend.

Below is a production-oriented starter guide, repo references, and a recommended project layout you can actually ship.

🐝 BeeWare Full-Stack Mobile (iOS + Android) with FastAPI
What You’ll Build

1. Frontend: BeeWare (Toga) – Python UI
2. Backend: FastAPI (full-stack-fastapi-template compatible)
3. Auth: JWT
